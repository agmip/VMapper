"all","Introduction:","This spreadsheet contains the full list of variables and codes used in the ICASA standards. A general description of the standards is available at www.icasa.net/standards. The assumption is that the standards will evolve through time, especially through addition of new variables and codes.","1",""
"all","AgMIP note:","A value of 2 in the ICASA_standard field indicates that the variable is included in the AgMIP standard.","2",""
